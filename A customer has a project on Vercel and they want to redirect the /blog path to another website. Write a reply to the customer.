Hi [customer name]

Vercel provides a simple method for rerouting your project's /blog path to a different website. Here's how to make this happen:

Vercel Redirects: This is the simplest approach and is effective in the majority of situations. This is what you must do:

• Open the settings for your Vercel project.
• Go to the "Settings" menu.
• Locate the area marked "Redirects".
Next, select "Add Redirect".
• Type "/blog" in the "Source" section, including the quotes.
• Type the complete URL (including https:// or http://) of the website you wish to redirect them to in the "Destination" section.
•One can select a type of redirect:
o 301 (Permanent): For long-term redirects, this is the suggested choice. The new location will be reflected in the indexing updates that search engines make.
If the redirection is only temporary, use 302 (Temporary).

Hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Arka Sengupta
