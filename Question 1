Describe how you solved a challenge that one of your previous teams faced. How did you determine your solution was successful?

We encountered a situation where we were always receiving false positives from Axe Monitor for a rule that was flagging ARIA characteristics while we were employed at Deque Systems. The development team was chasing ghosts, a waste of time! I investigated the rule and the items that were marked. As it turned out, the rule caught legitimate applications of ARIA characteristics but was overly general. Working along with the Axe Monitor group, we investigated how to improve the rule. Sadly, there was no way to do it. Consequently, in order to stop particular parts from being highlighted, we developed a suppression approach. Once the suppression was put into place, the number of false positives decreased. Developers might now concentrate on actual accessibility problems. Achievement? Of course! We reduced the amount of time wasted on false positives and made sure developers were fixing actual accessibility issues.
