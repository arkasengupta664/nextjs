Question: A customer has a project on Vercel and they want to redirect the /blog path to another website. Write a reply to the customer.

Hi [customer name],

Vercel provides a simple method for redirecting your project's /blog path to a different website. Here's how to make this happen:

The easiest way to do this is by using Vercel Redirects, which is effective in most situations. 
This is what you must do: 
  - Open the settings for your Vercel project. 
  - Go to the "Settings" menu. 
  - Locate the area marked "Redirects". 
  - Next, select "Add Redirect". 
  - Type "/blog" in the "Source" section, including the quotes. 
  - Type the complete URL (including https:// or http://) of the website you wish to redirect them to in the "Destination" section. 
  - One can select 2 types of redirect: 
      a) 301 (Permanent): For long-term redirects, this is the suggested choice. The new location will be reflected in the indexing updates that search engines make. 
      b) If the redirection is only temporary, use 302 (Temporary). 

Hope this informations helps! Please feel free to reach out to me in case you have any further queries.

Regards,
Arka Sengupta
