Question: Imagine that the customer from Question 4 responds with the following email.
“I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just
can’t figure it out. It must be a platform issue so why don't you just fix it for
me instead of asking me questions.”
Write a reply to the customer addressing the concerns raised.


Hi [customer name],

I can appreciate how frustrating it is for you to have to put up the redirect for the /blog path. If the prior choice appeared complicated, I apologize. Vercel redirection are usually quite simple, although I can understand how it could be incredibly discouraging to spend hours troubleshooting.
Let's take a different tack to rapidly settle this. Could you elaborate on the particular problems you're having with the redirect setup? Do you have any error messages visible?

We can troubleshoot together in the following two ways:
1. Walkthrough: If it's convenient for you, I can take you step-by-step through the Vercel redirect setup. Together, we can walk through the settings page and make sure everything is set up properly.
2. API Route Help: I can assist you in going over the code to make sure it's operating as intended if you're using a Next.js application and prefer the API Route technique.

The likelihood of this being a platform issue is quite low. Vercel redirects are a well-known feature, and problems can frequently be identified and resolved through debugging.
I'm determined to support you in completing this redirect. Don't be afraid to share the specifics of your previous attempts with us so that we can collaborate to find a solution.
For more information in the interim, go to https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/redirects, which is the Vercel documentation on redirects.

I appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Arka Sengupta
